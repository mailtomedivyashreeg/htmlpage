  <p>Always smile to make your life worthwhile.
    Life is not what you are living, it is all about how you are living.
    Always smile and pass it to other, it is basic rule of a happy life my brother.
    Life is full of challenges that bring in you lots of changes.
    Keep calm and enjoy the life with charm.
    Pleasure and pain are consecutive; its up to you whether you leave it or live it.
    Wasting your time is stupidity, utilize every second and live with dignity.
    Neither relatives nor wife, only you can change your life.
    Help others when they need, life is the way how you treat.
    Where happy life settles, age doesnt matters.
    Life is very short, so put worries apart and give your life a kick start.
    Life is precious; live it but dont waste!</p>
